text: In 2008, the average net price for families in the $0 - $30,000 income bracket was $14 lower than for those in the $30,001 - $48,000 income bracket.

concept:
iq1 << iq2
despite considerable tuition increases, generous financial aid brought down iq3 considerably.
in 2016, it was only $2k greater than iq1 in 2008.
but iq1 didn't experience the same pattern
it actually started growing
and in 2016 was several thousand dollars greater than iq3
this growth was also while iq4 experienced great falls in its net price
why isn't the money going to the students who need it?
