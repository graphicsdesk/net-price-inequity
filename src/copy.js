text: In 2008, the average net prices for families in the $0 - $30,000 and $30,001 - $48,000 income brackets differed by only $14.

text: In the last decade, the average net price for $30,001 - $48,000 families has grown nearly $1,000. 

text: However, the average net price for $0 - $30,000 families grew at a much faster rate. By the end of 2016, it was $4,321 greater than that for $30,001 - $48,000 families.

text: The average net price for $0 - $30,000 families had increased 120%, the greatest percent change out of every income bracket.

text: It is also the only income bracket to have increased, other than the $30,001 - $48,000 bracket.

text: The net price for students in the lower income bracket has doubled, but the net price for those in the higher income bracket has grown marginally.

text: If we take a look at the two higher income brackets, we see a similar pattern.
