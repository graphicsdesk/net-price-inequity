text: The average net price for $0 - $30,000 families grew at a much faster rate, however. By the end of 2016, it was $4,321 greater than that for $30,001 - $48,000 families.

concept:
iq1 << iq2
despite considerable tuition increases, generous financial aid brought down iq3 considerably.
in 2016, it was only $2k greater than iq1 in 2008.
but iq1 didn't experience the same pattern
it actually started growing
and in 2016 was several thousand dollars greater than iq3
this growth was also while iq4 experienced great falls in its net price
why isn't the money going to the students who need it?

Despite <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/lead/2016/05/05/unfunded-mandate-columbia-college-arts-and-sciences-and-bollinger-era/">record tuition hikes</a>, the increase in financial aid led the third-highest bracketâ€™s average net price to fall 58 percent.
Yet the opposite was true for the lowest income bracket, whose average net price grew 95 percent.
In fact, in 2016, the average net price for the lowest income bracket was $3,269 higher than that for the third-highest.
Students/households earning between $30,001 and $48,000 a year did not fare much better.
This is all while the net price for students/households earning between $75,001 and $110,000 a year dropped nearly 40 percent.
Expectedly, the net price for students/households earning over $110,000 a year did not decrease as much.`;
